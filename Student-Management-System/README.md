### Project Overview

 In this project I entered students data and got the data like total marks and percentage,etc.from it using the basic python operations. I made lists, dictionary and enterd data of students name and the subjects and their marks  in it and did some strings to print the name of topper in the certificate. 


### Learnings from the project

 I learned the use of split, get, data append, data removeand, etc. functions from the project.It is very useful for understanding the basic python programming.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 First I made the list of the students data then using the append and remove functionality I made changes in the data to correct it and then made a dictionary of subjects and marks obtained in those subjects by the student and found the percentage of the student from the data and then made dictionary of students and their marks and found the topper from it and then split the name of topper to print the name in certificate as I wanted.


### Challenges faced

 I didn't knew how to use the split function and what to do to find the name of the student of highest marks using the max function. So, I reffered the use of those functions and overcame of those challanges.
